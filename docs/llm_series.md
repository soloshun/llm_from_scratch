Yes, I get you very well 👍🏽. What you’re planning is smart: consistent, bite-sized content across **Medium + GitHub + LinkedIn**, all tied together as a **public learning journey**. It will strengthen your scholarship applications, improve your visibility in AI, and show proof of both technical and communication skills. Let’s break it down step by step:

---

## 1. **Medium Article Series**

### Title Style

Keep it structured, clear, and sequential. Example:

- _Building LLMs from Scratch (Part 01): Tokenization and Embeddings_
- _Building LLMs from Scratch (Part 02): Self-Attention Explained with Code_
- _Building LLMs from Scratch (Part 03): Multi-Head Attention with Visualization_
- _Building LLMs from Scratch (Part 04): Transformer Blocks in PyTorch_
- _Building LLMs from Scratch (Part 05): Training a Mini-Language Model_

💡Tip: Always prefix with **“Building LLMs from Scratch”** so readers can recognize the series.

### Article Structure

Each article should follow this flow:

1. **Intro**: One or two sentences about what this part covers and why it matters.
2. **Concept Explanation**: Simple, conceptual breakdown.
3. **Manim Visualization**: Embed or link to animation GIF/video.
4. **Code Walkthrough**: Minimal reproducible PyTorch code (link full code on GitHub).
5. **Wrap-up & Next Part Teaser**: E.g., “Next, we’ll extend this to multi-head attention…”

---

## 2. **GitHub Repo**

Create a repo that acts like the “home” for the project.

**Name suggestion:**

- `llm-from-scratch`
- `build-your-own-llm`
- `mini-transformer-series`

**Repo Structure:**

```
llm-from-scratch/
│── README.md  (series overview + links to Medium + LinkedIn)
│── part01_tokenization_embeddings.py
│── part02_self_attention.py
│── part03_multihead_attention.py
│── part04_transformer_block.py
│── part05_training.py
│── animations/   (manim videos/diagrams)
│── notebooks/   (optional Jupyter demos)
```

**README.md example sections:**

- 📘 About the Series
- 🔗 Medium Article Links
- 🎥 Animations (links to GIFs/videos)
- 💻 Source Code

---

## 3. **LinkedIn Posts**

Each time you publish:

- **Start with a hook**: “How does a Transformer actually understand context? 🤔 This week in my _Building LLMs from Scratch_ series, I break down self-attention step by step.”
- **Add a value snippet**: one image or short animation.
- **CTA (call-to-action)**: “Full article here 👉 \[Medium link]. Code and animations are open-source on GitHub: \[link].”
- Use hashtags: `#AI #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #LLMs #PyTorch #OpenSource`

---

## 4. **Consistency Plan**

Since your schedule is tight:

- Commit to **1 article + 1 LinkedIn post per week** (with GitHub update alongside).
- Keep animations **simple but explanatory** (not polished for YouTube yet).
- Skip voice-over for now. Add later if you expand to YouTube.

---

## 5. **Future Playlist Branding**

When you later transition to YouTube:

- Playlist name: _Building LLMs from Scratch_
- Each video title: _Part 01 – Tokenization and Embeddings Explained_

This will align perfectly with your Medium + GitHub + LinkedIn content.

---

✨ **End Result:**
By November, you’ll have at least 6–8 published parts, a strong GitHub repo, visible LinkedIn activity, and a consistent story to show Erasmus Mundus evaluators: not just _“I’m learning AI”_, but _“I’m building and teaching others about LLMs step by step.”_

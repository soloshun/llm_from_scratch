# Building LLMs From Scratch (Part 2): The Power of Tokenization

In [Part 1](https://soloshun.medium.com/building-llms-from-scratch-part-1-the-complete-theoretical-foundation-e66b45b7f379), we established the theoretical blueprint for our journey. We explored what an LLM is, its architecture, and the three-stage process we'll follow to build one.

Now, it’s time to get our hands dirty and take the first practical step: **Tokenization**.

Before a Large Language Model can understand or generate text, it must first see the text in a language it understands—the language of numbers. Tokenization is the crucial process of converting a raw string of text into a sequence of integers, where each integer represents a "token."

This article is the start of our coding journey. We will:

1.  Explore different tokenization strategies and their trade-offs.
2.  Build a simple, word-based tokenizer from scratch using Python.
3.  Dive deep into **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**, the sub-word tokenization algorithm that powers modern LLMs like GPT.
4.  See how a professional-grade tokenizer like OpenAI's `tiktoken` works in practice.

Let's start coding.

## Chapter 1: The Tokenization Dilemma: Words, Characters, or Something in Between?

How should we split up a sentence? The answer isn't as obvious as it seems. There are three main strategies, each with its own set of pros and cons.

#### 1. Word-Based Tokenization

This is the most intuitive approach. We simply split a sentence by spaces and punctuation.

- **Example**: `My hobby is playing cricket` -> `['My', 'hobby', 'is', 'playing', 'cricket']`
- **Problem**: This leads to a massive vocabulary. What happens when the model encounters a word it has never seen before, like "snowboarding"? This is the **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV)** problem. Furthermore, "boy" and "boys" would be treated as two completely separate words, losing their semantic connection.

#### 2. Character-Based Tokenization

Here, we split the text into its individual characters.

- **Example**: `My hobby` -> `['M', 'y', ' ', 'h', 'o', 'b', 'b', 'y']`
- **Pros**: The vocabulary is very small (e.g., ~256 characters for English), solving the OOV problem completely.
- **Cons**: It destroys the inherent meaning of words. The token sequence also becomes extremely long, making it computationally expensive for the model to learn meaningful patterns.

#### 3. Sub-word Tokenization

This is the modern approach that offers the best of both worlds. It balances vocabulary size and sequence length by breaking words into smaller, meaningful sub-units.

- **Rule 1**: Frequently used words (like "the", "is") remain as single tokens.
- **Rule 2**: Rare words (like "tokenization") are broken down into smaller sub-words (e.g., `['token', 'ization']`).

This method allows the model to handle OOV words gracefully and understand the relationship between words with a common root, like "token," "tokens," and "tokenizing." The most popular algorithm for this is **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**.

## Chapter 2: From Scratch: A Simple Word-Based Tokenizer

Let's build our first tokenizer to understand the core mechanics. We'll use a simple approach based on regular expressions to split text by punctuation and whitespace.

First, let's load some text to work with. We'll use "The Verdict" by Edith Wharton.

```python
# Assuming 'the-verdict.txt' is in a 'data/' folder
with open("data/the-verdict.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()

print(f"Total characters: {len(raw_text)}")
print(raw_text[:100])
```

Now, we can use a regex to split the text. This pattern splits by spaces and also keeps punctuation like commas and periods as separate tokens.

```python
import re

# Split the text into tokens
preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.?_!"()\']|--|\s)', raw_text)
# Remove empty strings and strip whitespace
preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]
```

With our list of tokens, we can now build a vocabulary and map each unique token to a unique integer ID.

```python
# Create a vocabulary of all unique tokens
all_tokens = sorted(list(set(preprocessed)))
vocab_size = len(all_tokens)
vocab = {token: integer for integer, token in enumerate(all_tokens)}

# Our vocabulary now maps each token to an ID
# e.g., {'!': 0, '"': 1, "'": 2, ... 'a': 115, ...}
```

Finally, we can wrap this logic in a simple tokenizer class with `encode` (text to IDs) and `decode` (IDs to text) methods.

```python
class SimpleTokenizerV1:
    def __init__(self, vocab):
        self.str_to_int = vocab
        self.int_to_str = {i: s for s, i in vocab.items()}

    def encode(self, text):
        preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
        preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]
        ids = [self.str_to_int[s] for s in preprocessed]
        return ids

    def decode(self, ids):
        text = " ".join([self.int_to_str[i] for i in ids])
        # A little regex magic to clean up spacing around punctuation
        text = re.sub(r'\s+([,.?!"()\'])', r'\1', text)
        return text
```

This works! But it has a major flaw: what if it sees a word not in its vocabulary? It will crash.

## Chapter 3: Handling the Unknown with Special Tokens

To make our tokenizer more robust, we need to handle unknown words and provide context markers. We'll introduce two special tokens:

- `<|unk|>`: Represents an unknown word (Out-of-Vocabulary).
- `<|endoftext|>`: A special marker used to separate different documents or text passages.

Let's create `SimpleTokenizerV2` by adding these tokens to our vocabulary and modifying the `encode` method to handle unknown words.

```python
# Add special tokens to the vocabulary
all_tokens.extend(["<|endoftext|>", "<|unk|>"])
vocab = {token: integer for integer, token in enumerate(all_tokens)}

class SimpleTokenizerV2(SimpleTokenizerV1): # Inherits from V1
    def encode(self, text):
        preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
        preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]
        # If a token is not in the vocab, replace it with '<|unk|>'
        preprocessed = [
            item if item in self.str_to_int
            else "<|unk|>" for item in preprocessed
        ]
        ids = [self.str_to_int[s] for s in preprocessed]
        return ids
```

Now, our tokenizer can handle any text without crashing. If it encounters a word like "brunch" (which wasn't in "The Verdict"), it will gracefully map it to the `<|unk|>` token ID.

## Chapter 4: The Industry Standard: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

Our simple tokenizer is a great start, but modern LLMs use a more sophisticated sub-word algorithm like **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**.

BPE was originally a data compression algorithm. For LLMs, it works by iteratively merging the most frequent pair of consecutive tokens in the vocabulary.

Let's walk through a simplified example from the `lecture_8_notes.md`.
Imagine our dataset consists of these words with their frequencies:
`{"old": 7, "older": 3, "finest": 9, "lowest": 4}`

1.  **Initialization**: We start by splitting every word into characters and adding a special `</w>` token to signify the end of a word.
    `{"o l d </w>": 7, "o l d e r </w>": 3, ...}`

2.  **Iteration 1**: We find the most frequent consecutive pair of tokens. Let's say it's `e` and `s`. We merge them into a new token, `es`.

    ![](../images/bpe_l8_frqt1.png)

3.  **Iteration 2**: Now, the most frequent pair might be `es` and `t`. We merge them to form `est`.

    ![](../images/bpe_l8_frqt2.png)

4.  **And so on...**: We continue this process for a set number of merges. We might merge `est` with `</w>` to get `est</w>`, or `o` with `l` to get `ol`.

This process creates a vocabulary that contains both individual characters and common sub-words. When the tokenizer sees a new word, it tries to build it using the longest possible tokens from its vocabulary.

- A known word like **"lowest"** might be tokenized as `['low', 'est</w>']`.
- An unknown word like **"hugging"** might be tokenized as `['hugg', 'ing</w>']`.

This approach elegantly solves the OOV problem and keeps the vocabulary size manageable.

## Chapter 5: Using a Professional-Grade Tokenizer: `tiktoken`

Building a BPE tokenizer from scratch is complex. In practice, we use highly optimized, pre-trained tokenizers. Let's look at `tiktoken`, the library used by OpenAI for its GPT models.

First, install it:
`pip install tiktoken`

Now, we can load a pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer and use it.

```python
import tiktoken

# Get the tokenizer for the GPT-2 model
tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")

text = "Hello, do you like tea? <|endoftext|> Akwirw ier"
integers = tokenizer.encode(text, allowed_special={"<|endoftext|>"})

print(integers)
# Output: [15496, 11, 466, 345, 588, 8887, 30, 220, 50256, 33901, 86, 343, 86, 220, 959]

strings = tokenizer.decode(integers)
print(strings)
# Output: "Hello, do you like tea? <|endoftext|> Akwirw ier"
```

Notice how it handles the nonsensical word "Akwirw ier." Instead of mapping it to `<unk>`, the BPE algorithm breaks it down into sub-word tokens it _does_ know: `['A', 'kw', 'ir', 'w', ' ', 'ier']`. This is the power of sub-word tokenization in action!

## Conclusion & What's Next

We've made significant progress in this part. We've gone from the basic theory of tokenization to building our own simple tokenizer, understanding the sophisticated BPE algorithm, and finally using a production-grade library.

Tokenization is the gateway for getting data into our LLM. Now that we can convert an entire text into a long sequence of token IDs, we need a way to prepare this sequence for training.

**In Part 3, we will create a data loader for our language model.** We'll learn how to take our token sequence and efficiently create input-target pairs in batches, which is the exact format our model will need for the pretraining stage.

Stay tuned, and happy coding!
